You are working as a web developer in the IT team of a university that has recently launched a startup incubation center called “GreenTech Innovation Hub.” 
The management has asked you to design a professional and visually appealing single-page website to introduce the center’s vision, services, and contact details to students and industry partners. 
Create an HTML5 web page structured with appropriate sections such as header, navigation menu, about, services, and contact information. All visual styling must be implemented using an external CSS file named style.css.
 The design should demonstrate effective use of CSS background properties (color, image, or gradient), various border styles (solid, dashed, double, with border-radius), and text formatting features (font-family, font-size, font-weight, text alignment, text-transform, and letter spacing). Ensure proper use of class and id selectors, padding, and margins for layout clarity. Inline CSS and internal <style> tags are strictly not allowed.
  The final output should be neat, responsive using basic CSS
